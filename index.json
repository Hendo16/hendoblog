[{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"Hello, world!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled around a bit with blogs throughout my life but had never really built one of my own like this - given i\u0026rsquo;m at the start of professional career and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of nieche knowledge I have, I thought this would be a great place to put it! As for what my first post would be, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do a long post (or a series of shorter ones) introducing myself and detailing how I ended up in development to begin with. I love to ramble so I suspect these might be broken up but we\u0026rsquo;ll see!\nSections:\nPrelude - Who Am I? Part 1 - Childhood; Or, how I discovered YouTube Part 2 - Dude, Get Your Own\u0026hellip; Prelude - Who Am I? The resume-eqe nature of the site makes this a little bit redudant but i\u0026rsquo;ll introduce myself formally anyway! I\u0026rsquo;m Nathan Henderson, a Sydney-based Software Developer who graduated UOW with a Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security) in 2024. As you might expect, I love playing around with computers and technology as a whole whether that\u0026rsquo;s in writing software or working with the hardware myself. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do some posts on this in the future, but when I\u0026rsquo;m not working on some sort of project on my desktop i\u0026rsquo;m in the garage building open-source PCB\u0026rsquo;s like the SD2PSX, modding my consoles with upgrades like adding more RAM to the OG Xbox or coming up with my own internal USB-C solution for the Slim PS2 (definently doing a post about that).\nOutside of tech, I love music, going to shows and recently took up my family\u0026rsquo;s time honored tradition of rallying behind the St. George Dragons, even if they completely fumble the ball (don\u0026rsquo;t tell my mum I said that she\u0026rsquo;ll kill me). I also take a keen interest in politics but, uh, that\u0026rsquo;s usually a hairy topic to get into so all i\u0026rsquo;ll say is i\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the Coalition and wish my fiance and I could afford to purchase a house in this city without needing to sell a kidney or two.\nOh, I also have been running a home server for the last 6 years that, yes, has plex, sonarr/radarr and all of the usual media server goodness but was also a fantastic entry point for me to gain a new appreciation for server-based applications and utilies. I have a reverse proxy setup in cloudflare and host my own private convert application, how cool is that!! Admittedly, most of my time with the server is spent in the beautiful application known as ErsatzTV, something I suspect will get a few mentions here. It basically hosts your own private IPTV network and lets you customise channels and schedules, including inserting commercials or \u0026ldquo;filler\u0026rdquo; at chapter points for all of your media files. From 24/7 Simpsons channels to my own private MTV or Movie channels, i\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of joy playing around with Ersatz.\nAnother important tidbit I\u0026rsquo;d like to mention is that it\u0026rsquo;s been almost 10 years since I started programming! I realised that the other day and I think that\u0026rsquo;s why I wanted to start this off with a ramble about my beginnings so why not start\u0026hellip; now!\nPart 1 - Childhood; Or, how I discovered YouTube When I think back to my earliest memories, a few spring to mind. I remember my first concert, seeing KISS at the Sydney Superdome in 2004 dressed up as Paul Stanley (there\u0026rsquo;s a photo somewhere of me with the facepaint being applied) and Paul Stanley pointing and waving at me before one of his staff members handed us a pick he wanted us to have (yes, we still have that pick safe and sound). I remember how much I loved putting the couches together and building a sort of fortress with a sheet running over the top and lying down playing Ratchet and Clank. But one of the most cherished memories I have, and geniuenly one of the most formative is when my parents took me to see Ice Age 2. That\u0026rsquo;s a weird setup, but stick with me!\nThis was about 2006, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a whole lot of money. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully aware at the time, but we were struggling a bit so getting the opportunity to go out to the movies was a big deal for us. The year prior we went to go see the Spongebob Squarepants Movie which was, again, a surprise for little Nathan but what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know was that my parents had to save up for that for most of the year. So imagine my surprise when, one day, we\u0026rsquo;re travelling to our local Westfield for a usual trip and suddenly we venture downstairs into the cinemas. I remember the rush of excitement that we\u0026rsquo;d be seeing something but my dad (lovingly) gaslit me and swiftly shot me down. \u0026ldquo;What? No, i\u0026rsquo;m just going to the toilet\u0026rdquo;. He returned with popcorn and my eyes lit up, I got so excited! I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much else from that time, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember if I enjoyed the movie or not (pretty sure I did) but what I do remember, to the point that I can relive this in my mind more than 20 yeras late, is a surpise trailer that was played before movie.\nThe trailer sounded epic and pans across a Superman logo which made sense as Superman Returns was coming out later that year but suddenly the camera shoots backwards and it shows Homer Simpsons wearing that shirt. I lost my shit. You need to understand, I was about 7 years old and had no access to the internet or news or anything but myself and my family were huge Simpsons fans, to the point my mum couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand watching it with us anymore because we\u0026rsquo;d watched it too many times. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know you could make a movie about a TV show, and the simpsons?! I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if they\u0026rsquo;d announced a movie was coming but i\u0026rsquo;ve sinced learnt the animators rushed through this trailer in secret to get it out in time as a surprise, and I can tell you it had the intended effect.\nWhy am I telling you all of this? Apart from my love of rambling, this was a very seminal moment in my life and I genuinely belive set me on the course i\u0026rsquo;m on today. It was first major special interest and it came at a very opportune time. Later that year we had moved into a newer, nicer home and also got a family laptop which was my gateway into tech and the internet as a whole. I searched high and low for anything I could about this movie, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much information out at the time apart from the fact that it was in production. At some point, I discovered the site and had that addressed burnt into my brain to the point where I still remember it to this day (simpsonsmovie.com) and in the years since it\u0026rsquo;s been fondly remembered for its virtual springfield and minigames but at the time it was a teaser site simply offering a download of the teaser i\u0026rsquo;d already seen. One day, though, a new trailer was uploaded and I remember sitting there on a blisteringly hot Australian day waiting 2+ hours for this trailer to download through our shitty dial up. I ate up every second of it!\nI could go on and on about this but I have to emphasise again that this was a feeling and obsession i\u0026rsquo;d never known before and it will ALWAYS hold a special place in my heart. Obviously my friends were quite excited about the movie too (maybe not to the extent that I was, but still) and it was through a friend where I heard about a site where they had HEAPS of simpsons movie trailers. That\u0026rsquo;s when he showed me \u0026ldquo;YouTube\u0026rdquo; for the first time. I kid you not, I found out about YouTube as a site that just had plenty of Simpsons Movie trailers. Obviously there were just uploads, but I remember sitting there with him during recess watching as many as we could. Then about a week later NSW blocked YouTube for all students.\nMy parents took me to see it on opening night and I felt like the luckiest kid alive. Obviously we all loved it, but that journey of exploration and digging through websites for more information never really went away - following the movie\u0026rsquo;s release, it was something that I kept doing. Greater Union\u0026rsquo;s website became a mainstay for me as well as the concept of finding new information on the internet related to things I love. Which worked out well, because the following year I got something that tangibly changed my life forever.\nPart 2 - Dude, Get Your Own\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a foreign concept nowadays but for any family that took an interest in playing video games, an important descision had to be made early in the childs life. Were you a PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo family? Given that my parents mostly grew up on the Sega Mega Drive they didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel an attachment to Nintendo, Sega had imploded when I was very young so they\u0026rsquo;d gone with PlayStation. I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure of why but I do remember watching my mum and dad playing Crash Bandicoot together on our PS1 when I was very young. Jump forward to the mid 2000\u0026rsquo;s and the coolest thing you or anyone else could own, for my money, was a PlayStation Portable.\nA mate of mine got the first model around 2007 and I was so very jealous of him, so naturally I started bugging my own family. Although we were doing better, we weren\u0026rsquo;t doing that much better so it was a bit of a big ask. My mum told me that if I worked really hard and got the highest tier of merit awards at the school (Gold Award) then I\u0026rsquo;d get one. Poor mum, however, didn\u0026rsquo;t know that the threshold for getting one of those had dropped significantly, so what would have originally required months and months of solid grades and good words from teachers turned into just generally being a straight shooter and within a couple of months I had my gold award. Oh, the betrayal I felt when that Gold Award wasn\u0026rsquo;t immediately converted into a PSP\u0026hellip;\nChristmas of that year (2008) I would finally recieve my own and I pratically lived with that thing. If you think about it, the PSP really was the first mobile phone like we think of it today. No, it couldn\u0026rsquo;t make phone calls, but it could play near console-quality games, play physical movies (!!!) and rip your own CD\u0026rsquo;s onto the memory stick duo. Something else the PSP could do that blew my fricking mind was play PS1 games. The idea of playing all 3 Crash Bandicoot games on the go excited me to no end! However, you could only purchase them digitally. At the time, most routers you got with your ISP\u0026rsquo;s were technically \u0026lsquo;modems\u0026rsquo; that simply gave you an ethernet port to plug your desktop into. Unless you wanted to spend a couple hudred dollars on a sepearte router there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a way to connect devices like the PSP to the internet.\nThere were utilies to get around this however, I remember Sony had an entertainment application on Windows where you could buy the games and then transfer them over but the bigger hurdle with this was my parents reluctance to purchase things online. One of them had gotten scammed via PayPal sometime before so they were very anti-online purchases unless it was through my mums work network. The work-around for this in the past was, of course, in-store vouchers that you could purchase like we\u0026rsquo;d done plenty of times before with iTunes. Playstation, however, had no such vouchers available anywhere within Australia. It was the bane of my existance, the PS1 games were right there staring at me. But if I couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy them, how else could I get the games onto my PSP\u0026hellip;.? Unless\u0026hellip;\nPart 3 - Is Piracy Wrong if a Child does it? Finding out that it was theoretically possible to get free games on the PSP felt like such a game-changer. Not only could I get any game I wanted that my parents wouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy for me but I could get my beloved PS1 games on the go!! I watched video after video about what \u0026ldquo;CFW\u0026rdquo; meant and how people used something called the \u0026ldquo;pandoras battery\u0026rdquo; to hack their PSPs as well as what a \u0026ldquo;PBP\u0026rdquo; file was and where to find some. The only problem, however, was I was on a firmware that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been cracked yet. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet, but all of the content I was watching was for PSPs on a lower firmware and there simply was not an exploit avilable for the 3.XX firmware that I was on. Of course I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand that yet, I was only 10 - so I kept searching. Time and time I would follow a tutorial hoping that if I just tried it this slightly different way maybe it\u0026rsquo;d work! I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t crack it for a number of years, but I found my salvation elsewhere - in the Nintendo Wii. Much to my surprise, my family shocked me with a Wii in 2009 and later that year I discovered the huge hacking scene that had coalesced around it. However this time, instead of these propriatery batteries and to be on an older firmware, all I needed was a typical SD Card. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe my luck when I first booted into the Hombrew Channel on my first attempt - what are the chances! My mind ran wild with what the possibilties were, after all of these years I finally had access to a hacked console! So I jumped online and began finding all of the things I could do from downloading homebrew games people had made to installing Virtual Console titles via .wad files. I got a few of the original Mario games setup, played for a couple of minutes and\u0026hellip;turned the Wii off. I suddenly lost interest in actually playing with the system i\u0026rsquo;d spent hours learning how to hack. It dawned on me that the thrill of researching and attempting to hack a console was so much more exciting than actually sitting down and playing pirated games on it. I have fond memories of my time with the Wii but most of it was spent just installing and un-installing random Virtual Console titles, custom themes and Mario Kart Wii mod packs.\nAnyway, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to this but this post is long enough as it is. It\u0026rsquo;s probably going to look a mess, too, as I\u0026rsquo;m still new to markdown formatting and how best to structure blog posts without making it this long, droning essay. Until next time!\n","date":"January 30, 2026","hero":"/hendoblog/posts/bio/hero.svg","permalink":"https://hendo16.github.io/hendoblog/posts/bio/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello, world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled around a bit with blogs throughout my life but had never really built one of my own like this - given i\u0026rsquo;m at the start of professional career and there\u0026rsquo;s a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of nieche knowledge I have, I thought this would be a great place to put it!

To begin with I looked for Blu-Rays and DVDs I owned that contained TV Spots as special features (some didnt even advertise TV Spots and just called the 30 second spot a \u0026rsquo;trailer\u0026rsquo;) but these are few and far between. Plus, you don\u0026rsquo;t want all of the ads to just be of movies so my attention then turned to YouTube. Most of these are 30+ minute long broadcast recordings so I began my search for ways to trim these down into individual files\u0026hellip;\n1. Premiere Pro and the beauty of D-VHS I\u0026rsquo;d dabbled with YouTube in a variety of ways over the years, whether editing friends videos or some of my own so I was quite familiar in Adobe\u0026rsquo;s Premiere Pro. At the time this seemed like the most logical solution, just chuck the downloaded YouTube video into a new Project and cut the commercials out one-by-one. It was a long and tedious but it worked. Sure, the quality wasn\u0026rsquo;t great but I just wrote that down to the poor quality of the VHS source. That was, until, I stumbled across a goldmine - the D-VHS tape. I can write a whole other blog post on these things but you can get quick summary of them here via TechMoan.\nThe video goes into Movies released on the format but they were treated like regular VHS tapes so those who had the money and were so inclined were about to record a clean 1080i signal from their TV in the early 2000s. And there is a singular legend who is not only ripping D-VHS tapes he finds onto sites like YouTube but also providing the raw data onto the Internet Archive. Here is an example - it is a 21.8GB .ts file that shows a clean and crisp recording of the 2006 Superbowl. Although I\u0026rsquo;m not one for NFL, in terms of getting interesting ads in the best quality possible this was an absolute revalation! Access to broadcast recordings this high quality from this time period is rare and it acted as a double-edged sword as it laid bare the flaw in my clip creation process. I\u0026rsquo;d soon learn the golden rule - never compress from a compressed source.\nSeeing how clean and crisp the footage was, I had to find a way to splice the commercials out in a way that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t require compression. Sure, I could tweak and tune the settings to get it just right but i\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a perfectionist and would have rathered keep the commercial files in their purest form. As such, I began searching for ways to cut segments out from a video without having to re-encode. Enter: Lossless Cut.\n2. Lossless Cut Lossless Cut is a fanastic tool, being a self-described \u0026ldquo;swiss army\u0026rdquo; knife of video editing. I have to say it is quite flexible, being a cross-platform app that runs low on resources but is fast, efficient and is seemingly perfectly built for my usecase. You simply add the video onto the tool and you can easily create a new \u0026ldquo;segment\u0026rdquo; for every clip you want to make. For me, that simply meant a new ad - and on top of that, I could still do the frame-by-frame navigation to make sure the clip started at the exact point the screen went black so all of the files I was creating wouldn\u0026rsquo;t carry anything from the advert before it. I was very excited to find this open-source tool that seemed perfectly built for me! Not only was it easier to map out the advertisements that I wanted as opposed to manually doing them one-by-one in Premiere Pro, but LosslessCut proclaimed to create these cuts without re-coding, so it retained all of the original video quality!\nMind you, if it was that simple then I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here writing this post. After making my first run through the app I soon realised an issue. No matter how precise my segment times were, the start of some of the ads always retained a second or two from the previous ad. Initially, I thought that I was doing something wrong so I played around with the advanced settings but couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to fix the issue. I saw there was a \u0026ldquo;Smart Cut\u0026rdquo; option that proclaimed to fix cutting issues but it never worked correctly, instead resulting in all of my clips to repeat themselves for a few seconds. That\u0026rsquo;s when I learnt about \u0026ldquo;keyframes\u0026rdquo;.\n3. How does Video Compression work? Videos are, at the end of the day, a collection of images. We all understand this conceptually, but what it actually means is videos are data hungry. Lets take a typical 30 second commercial at the NTSC broadcast rate of 29.97 FPS. That means you\u0026rsquo;d have about 899 images making up that video. Given that the NTSC standard has a resolution of 480p, an uncompressed full-data image comes to about 27MB, which would result in that 30 second 480p commercial being 810MB in size. Sure, we could store that find nowadays but by no means is that efficient. That\u0026rsquo;s why we have video compression and where these \u0026ldquo;keyframes\u0026rdquo; come into play. I\u0026rsquo;m by no means an expert, this is a hobby venture for me, but my understanding is that no matter the compression method applied to the frame the general concept remains the same.\nYou are trying to cut down on the video information that is stored on a frame-by-frame basis and this results in your video being made up of 3 frame types\nI-Frames P-Frames B-Frames Your I-Frame is a complete image. It may go through some form of compression from its pure uncompressed form but this frame will stand on its own, it is not dependant on another frame but rather will become the basis for the next two frame types.\nThe P-Frame is known as a Predicted Picture, as it stores the information that relate to the changes from the previous frame. As such, this frame has partial information about the video because it usually includes the smallest about of data possible.\nThe B-Frame is a Bi-Directional Predicted Picture and works in a similar manner to your P-Frame, however this has the potential to store the differences between the current frame as well as the following frame - creating further opportunities for storage space.\nThe Wikipedia page for Video Compression Types has this great infographic that demonstrates this in action\nAgain, the way these frames are handled and created will vary wildly depending on the compression algorithm you are using but at a low-level, this is a (very generalised) overview of Video Compression. However, this gives us enough information to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on!\n4. \u0026lsquo;Smart\u0026rsquo; cutting As you might have already guessed, the \u0026lsquo;I-Frame\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;keyframe\u0026rsquo;. Since it is not dependant on any previous frames and can stand on its own, tools like FFMPEG are able to create a new video starting from that exact point and continuing on. However, if the place you wish to cut from is on a P/B frame then that is simply impossible and the best option you have is to either re-encode from that point or go back to the most recent I-Frame. Although I found deep satisfaction from being able to identify exactly what was going on, and a greater appreciation for the process as a whole I found myself depleated. This is just how videos are made and there\u0026rsquo;s not much you can do - you HAVE to perform some sort of re-encoding if you want the video to start at the exact position you want it to\u0026hellip; but does that mean you have to re-encode the entire video?\nThe understanding of the process gave me an idea - if videos nowadays is just made up of I-Frame segments, what if we re-encoded up to the next I-Frame? That is, instead of re-encoding the entire video past the problematic cut, why couldn\u0026rsquo;t you just re-encode those first few seconds so the start point is correct and once you reach the next I-Frame, splice the video and append the remaining uncompressed video onto the re-encoded clip? From the looks of it, it seems as though this is exactly what Lossless Cut\u0026rsquo;s Smart Encode is attempting to do but like I said, I\u0026rsquo;d never had any actual luck with the process. Figured it was worth a shot, right?\n5. Custom GO Script To embark on this new journey, I downloaded a different tool that\u0026rsquo;s become a stable amongst multimedia enthusiasts - \u0026lsquo;avidemux\u0026rsquo;. A fantastic tool (if a little outdated) that allows you to quickly jump not only frame-by-frame but also keyframe-by-keyframe and it also shows you the type of frame you are looking at. I took a clip i\u0026rsquo;d pulled from a D-VHS source tape and found that the true start of the commercial was about 0.15 seconds into the clip. Then, I jumped into GO and started throwing together a quick little script that used FFMPEG wrappers like ffmpeg-go and ffprobe-go. FFProbe was first used to get information about the next closest keyframe from the given cut point. Unfortunetly, ffprobe-go didn\u0026rsquo;t include any frame information so I forked it and build the structs myself based on the terminal output I was getting, which has since been added into the library. Once we had that keyframe time, we passed it into FFMpeg to build up the two segments.\nBecause we are trying to append these two segments together its important that the first re-encoded segment matches the source video near identically. So, we needed to pull information about the codec as well as bitrate information. The bitrate won\u0026rsquo;t affect our ability to append, but I found that with the D-VHS source having a mpeg2video codec, FFMPEG\u0026rsquo;s default is super blocky so I just told it to match the source\u0026rsquo;s max bitrate. These segments were generated just fine, cutting out the initial information I wanted to leave out and ending right at the following keyframe.\nNext, we had to take that keyframe timecode and create a secondary segment that continued onwards from the keyframe, but ensuring we are copying the video out so that no video information was lost. Its a simple operation so it didn\u0026rsquo;t require too much work so once these two segments were generated I quickly went ahead and tried to append them together and \u0026hellip; it kind of worked? The vision was there, you could see that the commercial started exactly when I needed it to and visually it flowed nicely with only a second or two of blocky compression artifacts but it would stutter or freeze at the join point. I did some research and it turns out that although i\u0026rsquo;d been using the timecode the keyframe was associated with, because this was a raw D-VHS broadcast tape it included all the broadcast metadata associated with that which is reliant on syncing up the video with the audio, as well as making sure its staying on time. By forcibly splicing part of the video away and creating a new video that was seconds in but acting as though the start time would be 0, it created this broken mismatch of the timecodes.\nFFMPEG can handle this for you, however, by simply massing through flags like +ggpts to re-generate the timecodes as well as \u0026ldquo;-avoid_negative_ts make_zero\u0026rdquo; to shift the timestamps.\n","date":"January 30, 2026","hero":"/hendoblog/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://hendo16.github.io/hendoblog/posts/vid-cutting/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEver since I first discovered \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eErsatzTV\u003c/a\u003e, the FOSS that allows you to host your own IPTV network, I\u0026rsquo;d become fascinated with building up a collection commercials, or \u0026lsquo;filler\u0026rsquo; as Ersatz calls them, to play in-between content.
