# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software developer with 4 years of working experience. I love all things tech, whether that is gaming, servers or even fixing broken hardware - I am always looking to work on something engaging. I am big on movies and music; Searching for ways to merge my passions with my career path has led me to work on some pretty cool projects from teaching myself HLS streaming/downloading when I started learning to code in Python to build a custom Rooster Teeth downloader, or the smart lossless video encoder service I am working on now through GO and FFMPEG.'
