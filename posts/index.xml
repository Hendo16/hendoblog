&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled around a bit with blogs throughout my life but had never really built one of my own like this - given i&amp;rsquo;m at the start of professional career and there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of nieche knowledge I have, I thought this would be a great place to put it! As for what my first post would be, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a long post (or a series of shorter ones) introducing myself and detailing how I ended up in development to begin with. I love to ramble so I suspect these might be broken up but we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Journey for the (almost) lossless video cutting software</title><link>https://hendo16.github.io/hendoblog/posts/vid-cutting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://hendo16.github.io/hendoblog/posts/vid-cutting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I first discovered &lt;a href="https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ErsatzTV&lt;/a&gt;, the FOSS that allows you to host your own IPTV network, I&amp;rsquo;d become fascinated with building up a collection commercials, or &amp;lsquo;filler&amp;rsquo; as Ersatz calls them, to play in-between content. To begin with I looked for Blu-Rays and DVDs I owned that contained TV Spots as special features (some didnt even advertise TV Spots and just called the 30 second spot a &amp;rsquo;trailer&amp;rsquo;) but these are few and far between. Plus, you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the ads to just be of movies so my attention then turned to YouTube. Most of these are 30+ minute long broadcast recordings so I began my search for ways to trim these down into individual files&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
